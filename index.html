<p>I am a data scientist at a financial firm in New York City.</p>

<p>
Before joining the finance world, I did a Bachelor's and Master's degree in
Information Science and Technology at the <a
    href="http://shc.psu.edu/">Schreyer Honors College at Penn State</a>. At
Penn State, I worked on text mining systems that can automatically idenfity and
categorize descriptions of chronic disease symptoms in online messages. You can
check out my thesis work <a
    href="https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/paper/21204/">here</a>. I also worked on probabilistic topic models and supervised learning systems to <a href="http://knowledge.amia.org/amia-55142-a2013e-1.580047/t-03-1.584514/f-003-1.584515/a-380-1.584588/a-382-1.584583?qr=1"> detect emotional states in personal journal entries.</a>
