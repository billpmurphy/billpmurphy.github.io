models, web scrapers, and software tools for financial analysts.</p>.

Before joining the finance world, I did a Bachelor's and Master's degree in
Information Science and Technology at the <a
href="http://shc.psu.edu/">Schreyer Honors College at Penn State</a>. For my
masters thesis, I worked on text mining systems that
can automatically <a

symptoms in online messages</a>. I also worked on probabilistic topic models
and supervised learning systems to <a
