<p>I am a data scientist at a financial firm in New York City.</p>

<p>
Before joining the finance world, I did a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Information Science at the <a href="http://shc.psu.edu/">Schreyer Honors College at Penn State</a>. At Penn State, I worked on text mining systems that can automatically idenfity and categorize descriptions of chronic disease symptoms in online messages. You can check out my thesis work <a href="https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/paper/21204/">here</a>.
